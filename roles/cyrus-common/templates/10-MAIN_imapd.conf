# If enabled, activate the alternate namespace as documented in
# /usr/share/doc/cyrus-doc-2.2/html/altnamespace.html, where an user's
# subfolders are in the same level as the INBOX

# UNIX Hierarchy Convention
# Set to yes, and cyrus will accept dots in names, and use the forward
# slash "/" to delimit levels of the hierarchy. This is done by converting
# internally all dots to "^", and all "/" to dots. So the "rabbit.holes"
# mailbox of user "helmer.fudd" is stored in "user.elmer^fud.rabbit^holes"
unixhierarchysep: yes

# Allow user mailbox rename
# Set to yes, and cyrus allow mailbox rename.
# Need Cyrus 2.2 or greater
# Warning: measures should be taken to make sure that the user being moved is
# not logged in, and can not login during he move.
# Failure to do so may result in the userâ€™s meta-data (seen state,
# subscriptions, etc) being corrupted or out of date.

allowusermoves: yes

# Rejecting illegal characters in headers
# Headers of RFC2882 messages must not have characters with the 8th bit
# set. However, too many badly-written MUAs generate this, including most
# spamware. Enable this to reject such messages.

# Munging illegal characters in headers
# Headers of RFC2882 messages must not have characters with the 8th bit
# set. However, too many badly-written MUAs generate this, including most
# spamware. If you kept reject8bit disabled, you can choose to leave the
# crappage untouched by disabling this (if you don't care that IMAP SEARCH
# won't work right anymore.
#munge8bit: no

# Forcing recipient user to lowercase
# Cyrus 2.2 is case-sensitive.  If all your mail users are in lowercase, it is
# probably a very good idea to set lmtp_downcase_rcpt to true.  This is set by 
# default, per RFC2821. This was not set by default in debian versions up to
# and including 2.2.12-4.

# overrides the "admins" parameter above

# List of remote realms whose users may log in using cross-realm

#loginrealms: test.fr

# Enable virtual domain support.  If enabled, the user's domain will
# be determined by splitting a fully qualified userid at the last '@'
# or '%' symbol.  If the userid is unqualified, and the virtdomains
# option is set to "on", then the domain will be determined by doing
# a reverse lookup on the IP address of the incoming network
# interface, otherwise the user is assumed to be in the default
# domain (if set).
#
virtdomains: userid

# The default domain for virtual domain support
# If the domain of a user can't be taken from its login and it can't
# be determined by doing a reverse lookup on the interface IP, this
# domain is used.

# Enable this option when migrating from an SingleNameSpace installation
# IMPORTANT :
#    - see LDAP filter into '/etc/saslauthd.conf' too
#    - set 'virtdomains: userid' into '/etc/imapd.conf' and restart Cyrus
#      before launching global update
# ie: migrating a single namespace installation, domain : foo.com
